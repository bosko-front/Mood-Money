# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-12-04

This Privacy Policy explains how MoodMoney ("MoodMoney," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the practices described below. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

1. Who we are and how to contact us
- App: MoodMoney
- Contact email for privacy requests: boskojaksic2407995@gmail.com
- If you cannot access in‑app privacy options, you can reach us at the email above.

2. Scope
This Policy applies to personal data we process when you access or use the Service. It does not cover third‑party websites, services, or apps that we do not control.

3. Information we collect
We collect the following categories of information:
- Account information: email address, authentication identifiers, profile settings.
- Usage and device data: app and device identifiers, operating system, app version, IP address, timestamps, language/locale, timezone, crash logs, diagnostics, and performance data.
- Content you provide: financial entries (e.g., income/expenses, categories, amounts), text notes, and optional attachments you choose to upload (e.g., receipts, images). Depending on your use, mood entries or notes may reveal sensitive information in some jurisdictions.
- Subscription and transaction data: purchase history, product identifiers, trial status, and related metadata provided by app stores and billing infrastructure (no full payment card numbers are processed by us).
- Communications: your messages to us (e.g., support requests or feedback).
- Push notification tokens: device tokens used to send push notifications (you can opt out in device settings).

4. Sources of information
We obtain personal data from:
- You, when you create an account, add entries, or communicate with us.
- Your device, automatically via app telemetry and cookies/SDKs (where applicable).
- Platform providers (Apple, Google) and subscription processors (e.g., RevenueCat) for purchase validation.
- Service providers we use to operate the Service (see Section 7).

5. How we use information (purposes)
We use personal data for:
- Providing and operating the Service, including syncing, storage, backup, and account management.
- Personalizing features (e.g., recommended insights) and improving the Service.
- Generating AI‑assisted insights or summaries based on your inputs and permitted data.
- Communicating with you (e.g., important notices, support, updates).
- Analytics, performance monitoring, debugging, and crash reporting.
- Fraud prevention, abuse detection, and security monitoring.
- Compliance with legal obligations and enforcement of our Terms of Use.

6. Legal bases for processing (EEA/UK only)
Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, we process personal data on the following legal bases:
- Performance of a contract: to provide the Service and support.
- Legitimate interests: to secure, improve, and analyze the Service, prevent fraud, and communicate non‑marketing product notices. We balance our interests against your rights.
- Consent: for optional features where required by law (e.g., certain analytics/telemetry, push notifications, or AI processing if applicable). You can withdraw consent at any time via app/device settings where available.
- Legal obligations: to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

7. Sharing and disclosures
We do not sell your personal information. We share personal data with:
- Service providers (processors) acting on our behalf, including:
  - Firebase by Google (Authentication, Firestore/Database/Storage, Analytics, Crashlytics) to authenticate users, store data, measure usage, and monitor crashes.
  - RevenueCat (subscription management) to validate purchases and manage entitlements.
  - Expo/Expo Push Notification Service (where used) to deliver push notifications.
  - OpenAI (or similar AI providers) to generate AI insights from user‑provided content where you invoke such features.
  - Platform providers (Apple App Store, Google Play) for in‑app purchases and distribution.
- Professional advisors, auditors, and legal authorities when necessary for legal, compliance, or security reasons.
- Business transfers: in connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, subject to appropriate safeguards.

We require our processors to handle personal data according to our instructions and applicable laws, and not to use the data for their own purposes.

8. International data transfers
We may process and store information in countries outside your own, including the United States and the EU. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for cross‑border transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission. You can contact us for more information about these safeguards.

9. Data retention
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate and lawful purposes, including record‑keeping, security, fraud prevention, and legal compliance. Typical retention guidelines:
- Account data: retained while your account is active. If you request deletion, we delete or anonymize within a reasonable period, subject to legal obligations.
- Content (entries/notes/uploads): retained while your account is active or until you delete it.
- Analytics and logs: retained for a limited period necessary for analytics and security (commonly 14–24 months for certain analytics, shorter for logs), unless a longer period is required by law or to investigate issues.

10. Your rights and choices
Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data.
- Object to or restrict certain processing, and withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
- Receive your data in a portable format (data portability).
- Opt out of certain analytics or targeted communications where applicable.

How to exercise your rights:
- In‑app: Where available, use account settings to export or delete your data.
- Contact: Email support@moodmoney.app (or boskojaksic2407995@gmail.com) to submit a request. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.

11. State and regional notices
- California (CPRA/CCPA): We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising as defined by CPRA. You have the right to know, delete, correct, and opt out of certain uses/disclosures. Authorized agents may submit requests per CPRA rules. We do not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.
- EEA/UK: You can lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Contact us first and we will do our best to resolve your concerns.
- Other regions: You may have similar rights under local law.

12. Security
We use reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest where supported by our providers (e.g., Firebase). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If we become aware of a data breach that affects your rights, we will notify you and regulators as required by law.

13. Children’s privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal data to us, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete such data. If the law where you live requires a higher minimum age, you must be at least that age to use the Service.

14. AI features
When you use AI‑assisted features, certain inputs and context you choose to include may be transmitted to our AI provider(s) to generate outputs. We contractually require providers not to use your data to train their general models unless they provide an opt‑out and your jurisdiction allows it; where applicable we will opt out of training by default for user content. Do not include confidential or personal information you are not comfortable sharing with such providers. AI outputs may be inaccurate—see our Terms of Use for important disclaimers.

15. Do Not Track and signals
We currently do not respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals. We honor platform‑level privacy settings to the extent supported by our SDKs and your device.

16. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (e.g., in‑app notice or email where available) and update the Effective Date above. Your continued use of the Service after the update becomes effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
